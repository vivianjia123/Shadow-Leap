# Shadow-Leap

Shadow Leap is an arcade game where the player must correctly time their leaps to guide the frog to the other side of the road and river, while avoiding falling into the river or getting run over by cars. The game is divided into vehicles, tiles, and rideable objects.

In this project, I create a graphical arcade game in the Java programming language. The graphics is handled using the Slick graphics library.

The specific requirement is described in [Project 2](https://github.com/vivianjia123/Shadow-Leap/blob/main/project2.pdf).
